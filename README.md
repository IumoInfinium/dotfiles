# my dotfiles source

source for all the dotfiles and config on my system

It has been collected, stolen, tried and tested to fit my needs.

# Checks

- Rename `.Sgitconfig` file to `.gitconfig`, and adding the email and username for the account that need to be globally usable.
- Change the names of the ssh-ids in `.bashrc`
